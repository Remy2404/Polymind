Summary of support_tool_call.py Logic Fix
=========================================

## Problem Identified
The support_tool_call.py file had outdated logic for detecting tool calling support:
- Detected only 27/72 models (37.5%) as supporting tool calls
- Used outdated keyword matching and restrictive provider checks
- Had duplicate logic that didn't align with model_configs.py (61/72 models, 84.7%)

## Solution Applied
1. Updated _supports_tool_calling() method to use centralized logic
2. Removed outdated helper methods (_provider_supports_tools, _model_name_supports_tools)
3. Now uses ModelConfigurations.model_supports_tool_calls() for consistency

## Results After Fix
- Both systems now report identical results: 61/72 models (84.7%)
- Perfect alignment between support_tool_call.py and model_configs.py
- Centralized logic ensures consistency across the system

## Test Results
✅ support_tool_call.py now correctly identifies 61 tool-calling models
✅ No discrepancies between detection methods
✅ All functionality working correctly

## Models Correctly Excluded (11 total)
These models correctly do NOT support tool calls:
- gemini (native Gemini API)
- dolphin-mistral-24b-venice-edition (dolphin pattern)
- hunyuan-a13b-instruct (hunyuan pattern)
- gemma-* models (gemma pattern) - 6 models
- dolphin3-r1-mistral-24b (dolphin pattern)

## Models Now Correctly Included (34 additional)
These models are now correctly identified as supporting tool calls:
- All new models added from tools.json (10 models)
- Various OpenRouter models that were missed by old keyword matching
- Models like llama4-maverick, reka-flash-3, glm-4-5-air, etc.

The fix ensures that the tool calling detection is accurate and consistent
across all parts of the system.
