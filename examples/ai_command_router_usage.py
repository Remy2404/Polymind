"""
Example Usage of AI Command Router

This file demonstrates how the new intelligent command routing works.
Users can now chat naturally and the bot will automatically detect
what they want to do and execute the appropriate commands.

# Example conversations that will now be automatically routed:

# How the AI Command Router works:

WORKFLOW_EXPLANATION = """
ü§ñ AI Command Router Workflow:

1. USER SENDS MESSAGE
   - User types natural language: "Create a document about climate change"

2. INTENT DETECTION  
   - AI analyzes message using pattern matching and keywords
   - Detects intent: GENERATE_DOCUMENT (confidence: 0.85)

3. PROMPT EXTRACTION
   - Extracts core topic: "climate change" 
   - Removes command words like "create", "document", etc.

4. COMMAND ROUTING
   - Automatically calls: command_handlers.generate_ai_document_command()
   - Sets context.args = ["climate", "change"]

5. EXECUTION
   - Document generation proceeds as if user typed "/gendoc climate change"
   - User gets their document without needing to know specific commands

6. FALLBACK
   - If intent detection fails or command execution fails
   - Falls back to normal chat conversation with AI

BENEFITS = """
‚ú® Benefits for Users:

üîπ NATURAL INTERACTION: Just describe what you want in plain English
üîπ NO COMMAND MEMORIZATION: Don't need to remember /gendoc, /generate_image, etc.
üîπ INTELLIGENT ROUTING: Bot understands context and intent automatically  
üîπ SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE: Commands execute automatically in background
üîπ FALLBACK SAFETY: Still works as normal chatbot if intent unclear
üîπ MULTILINGUAL: Works with natural language in different styles

üìà Business Value:

üí∞ INCREASED USAGE: Users more likely to use features they don't need to remember
üìä BETTER UX: Reduces friction between user intent and feature execution  
üéØ FEATURE DISCOVERY: Users naturally discover capabilities through conversation
üöÄ COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: More intuitive than command-based bots
