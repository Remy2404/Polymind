# Production OOM (Out of Memory) Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The Telegram Gemini Bot was experiencing OOM (Out of Memory) errors in production:
- Application exited with code 137 (OOM)
- Instance became unhealthy and required recovery
- Missing `hf_xet` package causing inefficient model downloads

## Root Causes
1. **Large Model Usage**: The bot was trying to load large Whisper models (`large-v3`) in production
2. **Inefficient Downloads**: Missing `hf_xet` package caused slower, more memory-intensive downloads
3. **No Memory Management**: Lack of memory monitoring and garbage collection
4. **No Production Optimization**: Same model sizes used in both development and production

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Production Environment Detection ‚úÖ
- Added `is_production_environment()` method to detect production environments
- Checks for: Railway, Heroku, and other common production indicators
- Environment variables: `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT`, `HEROKU_APP_NAME`, `PRODUCTION`, `NODE_ENV`, `ENVIRONMENT`

### 2. Memory Optimization ‚úÖ
- **Memory Monitoring**: Added `get_memory_usage()` function using `psutil`
- **Garbage Collection**: Implemented `optimize_memory()` with automatic GC triggers
- **Memory Limits**: Configured thresholds for memory usage warnings
- **Model Cache Management**: Proper cleanup of loaded models when memory is constrained

### 3. Production-Optimized Model Selection ‚úÖ
```python
# Production Model Sizes (Memory Optimized)
PRODUCTION_MODEL_SIZES = {
    VoiceQuality.LOW: "tiny",      # 39MB
    VoiceQuality.MEDIUM: "tiny",   # 39MB (instead of base: 74MB)
    VoiceQuality.HIGH: "base",     # 74MB (instead of large-v3: 1550MB)
}

# Production Language Models (Smaller Sizes)
PRODUCTION_LANGUAGE_MODELS = {
    "km": "base",      # Khmer: 74MB (instead of large-v3: 1550MB)
    "kh": "base",      # Alternative Khmer code
    "zh": "base",      # Chinese: 74MB (instead of large-v3: 1550MB)
    "ja": "base",      # Japanese: 74MB (instead of large-v3: 1550MB)
    # ... other languages optimized
}
```

### 4. Optimized Package Dependencies ‚úÖ
- **Added `hf_xet>=0.3.0`**: Optimizes Hugging Face model downloads
- **Removed Duplicate Dependencies**: Cleaned up `pytest` duplicates
- **Memory-Efficient Packages**: Ensured all packages support memory-efficient operations

### 5. Model Loading with Fallback ‚úÖ
- **Memory-Based Fallback**: If larger model fails to load, automatically tries smaller models
- **Progressive Reduction**: `large-v3` ‚Üí `base` ‚Üí `tiny`
- **OOM Detection**: Catches memory errors and prevents cascade failures
- **Production Mode**: Uses conservative memory settings (1 worker, int8 compute type)

### 6. Smart Model Selection Logic ‚úÖ
```python
# Production Mode Strategy
if is_production_environment():
    if high_resource_language:
        model_sizes = [optimal_model_size, "tiny"]  # Try optimal, fallback to tiny
    else:
        model_sizes = ["tiny", optimal_model_size]  # Start conservative

# Memory Monitoring During Processing
if memory_usage['percent'] > 90:
    # Skip larger models, use only tiny
    skip_to_smallest_model()
```

### 7. Enhanced Error Handling ‚úÖ
- **Memory Error Detection**: Catches OOM, allocation errors, and memory-related exceptions
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to smaller models instead of crashing
- **Production Logging**: Detailed memory usage logging for monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Monitor memory usage and trigger alerts at 85%+ usage

## Memory Usage Comparison

| Model Size | Memory Usage | Production Usage |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| `tiny`     | ~39MB        | ‚úÖ Primary       |
| `base`     | ~74MB        | ‚úÖ Secondary     |
| `large-v3` | ~1550MB      | ‚ùå Disabled      |

## Test Results ‚úÖ
```
üìä Memory Usage:
  ‚Üí RSS Memory: 18.8 MB
  ‚Üí Memory Percent: 0.1%
  ‚Üí Available Memory: 1117.9 MB

üéØ Model Size Selection:
  ‚Üí English Medium: tiny (Memory Optimized: YES)
  ‚Üí Khmer High: base (Memory Optimized: YES) 
  ‚Üí Chinese High: base (Memory Optimized: YES)

‚úÖ Production optimization test completed!
üéâ All tests passed! Production optimization is working correctly.
```

## Expected Impact
1. **Reduced Memory Usage**: 95%+ reduction in model memory usage (1550MB ‚Üí 74MB max)
2. **Improved Stability**: No more OOM crashes in production
3. **Faster Downloads**: `hf_xet` package improves model download performance
4. **Better Performance**: Smaller models load faster and use less CPU
5. **Cost Savings**: Can run on smaller instances with less memory

## Monitoring & Maintenance
- Monitor memory usage logs in production
- Track model performance with smaller models
- Adjust memory thresholds if needed
- Consider upgrading instance size only if absolutely necessary

## Files Modified
- `pyproject.toml`: Added `hf_xet` dependency
- `src/services/media/voice_config.py`: Added production optimization logic
- `src/services/media/voice_processor.py`: Implemented memory management
- `test_production_optimization.py`: Added comprehensive test

The production OOM issue should now be resolved! üéâ
