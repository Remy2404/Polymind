# Improved Khmer Voice Detection

## 🚨 Problem Addressed

Users speaking in Khmer (ភាសាខ្មែរ) were experiencing transcription issues where their speech was being incorrectly detected as English, with transcriptions like:
- "So, slide on it. So, slide on it."
- "And this is the first time I've ever seen it"

These errors occurred because:
1. The system was using the user's preferred language setting (English)
2. Whisper models have bias toward high-resource languages
3. False positive detection wasn't catching specific Khmer greeting mistranscriptions

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced User Language Context

- **User History Analysis**: Now checks if the user has previously used Khmer in text messages
- **Language Override**: Automatically switches to Khmer processing for users with Khmer history
- **Adaptive Language Setting**: More likely to use Khmer settings for users with history of Khmer usage

### 2. Extended False Positive Detection

- **Enhanced Pattern Matching**: Added specific patterns for common Khmer greeting mistranscriptions
- **Confidence Thresholding**: Different confidence thresholds based on user language history
- **Common Phrase Detection**: Added detection for common Khmer greeting phrases like "តើ អ្នក សុខសប្បាយ ជាទេ?" (How are you?)

### 3. Audio Characteristic Analysis

- **Short Message Detection**: Special handling for short messages (typically greetings)
- **Audio Profile Analysis**: Examines audio characteristics that are typically different in Khmer speech
- **Dynamic Processing**: Applies Khmer-specific audio preprocessing based on detected characteristics

### 4. Auto-Detection First Strategy

- **Two-Pass Transcription**: First tries auto-detection for short messages before forcing language
- **Intelligent Language Switching**: Switches to Khmer enhanced processing if audio characteristics match
- **Confidence-Based Selection**: Uses higher confidence results when auto-detection is strong

## 📊 Expected Results

The enhancements should significantly improve Khmer speech recognition by:

1. **Recognizing returning Khmer speakers** based on message history
2. **Better handling short Khmer greetings** that were previously mistranscribed
3. **Analyzing audio characteristics** to determine if speech sounds like Khmer
4. **Providing clearer feedback** when Khmer is detected but set to English

## 🧪 Testing

To verify these improvements:

1. Send a Khmer greeting like "សួស្តី" or "តើ អ្នក សុខសប្បាយ ជាទេ?" as a voice message
2. The system should now detect this as Khmer even if your preference is set to English
3. For returning Khmer users, the system should automatically prioritize Khmer detection

## 📈 Future Improvements

Additional enhancements could include:

1. Building a dedicated Khmer voice profile for regular Khmer users
2. Implementing user feedback collection for incorrect transcriptions
3. Developing a fine-tuned model specifically for Khmer recognition
