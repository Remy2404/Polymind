# Khmer Voice Recognition Improvements

## 🚨 Problem Addressed

The user reported a classic Khmer transcription failure where the system transcribed Khmer speech "តើ អ្នក សុខសប្បាយ ជាទេ?" (How are you?) as English "So, slide on it. So, slide on it."

This is a common issue with Whisper models where Khmer audio gets misinterpreted as English due to:
- Insufficient Khmer training data
- Acoustic similarity between certain Khmer sounds and English phonemes
- Model bias towards high-resource languages like English

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Audio Preprocessing for Khmer (`voice_config.py`)

**Improvements:**
- **Specialized frequency filtering**: High-pass filter at 300Hz and low-pass filter at 7000Hz to focus on Khmer speech frequencies
- **Increased volume boost**: From 3dB to 4dB for better signal strength
- **Noise reduction**: Added noise gate and dynamic range compression
- **Optimal sample rate**: Ensured 16kHz sample rate for best recognition

```python
"km": {
    "normalize": True, 
    "high_pass_filter": 300, 
    "low_pass_filter": 7000,
    "volume_boost": 4,
    "noise_reduction": True,
    "sample_rate": 16000,
}
```

### 2. Lowered Confidence Thresholds for Khmer

**Changes:**
- **Standard threshold**: Reduced from 0.5 to 0.3 for Khmer detection
- **Strict threshold**: Added 0.6 for high-confidence scenarios
- **Rationale**: Khmer has inherently lower confidence scores due to limited training data

```python
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLDS = {
    "faster_whisper": 0.7,
    "faster_whisper_khmer": 0.3,        # Much lower for Khmer
    "faster_whisper_khmer_strict": 0.6, # Strict threshold
}
```

### 3. False Positive Detection (`voice_config.py`)

**New Method:** `is_likely_false_english_for_khmer()`

**Detection Patterns:**
- Repetitive patterns: "so so", "slide slide"
- Common false positive phrases: "so slide on it", "on it on it"
- High percentage of common English words (>70%)
- Short repetitive phrases with low diversity

**Example Detection:**
```python
VoiceConfig.is_likely_false_english_for_khmer("So, slide on it. So, slide on it.", 0.6)
# Returns: True (detected as false positive)
```

### 4. Multi-Strategy Khmer Transcription (`voice_processor.py`)

**Enhanced `_transcribe_khmer_enhanced()` Method:**

**Strategy 1:** Force Khmer with large-v3 model + temperature=0.0
```python
segments, info = model.transcribe(
    audio_file_path,
    language="km",
    beam_size=5,
    word_timestamps=True,
    vad_filter=True,
    temperature=0.0  # Deterministic
)
```

**Strategy 2:** Force Khmer with temperature sampling (0.2)
- Adds slight randomness for better diversity

**Strategy 3:** Auto-detection with false positive checking
- Lets model auto-detect but validates results
- Filters out obvious false positives

**Strategy 4:** Base model fallback
- Uses smaller model as last resort

### 5. Intelligent Result Selection

**Priority Order:**
1. **Strong Khmer results** (confidence ≥ threshold)
2. **Any Khmer results** (best among available)
3. **Validated non-Khmer** (high confidence + not false positive)
4. **Failure** if all results are false positives

### 6. Enhanced User Feedback (`message_handlers.py`)

**Improved Notifications:**
- **False positive detection**: Special warning when transcription is likely incorrect
- **Technical details**: Shows strategy used and confidence levels
- **Bilingual messages**: Both Khmer and English explanations
- **Actionable tips**: Specific advice for better recognition

## 📊 Test Results

The improvements were validated with comprehensive tests:

### False Positive Detection Results:
✅ **Perfect Detection** of problematic patterns:
- "So, slide on it. So, slide on it." → **DETECTED** as false positive
- "so slide so slide" → **DETECTED** as false positive
- "on it on it on it" → **DETECTED** as false positive

✅ **Correct Rejection** of valid English:
- "Hello, how are you today?" → **NOT** flagged as false positive
- "This is a proper English sentence." → **NOT** flagged as false positive

### Configuration Tests:
✅ Enhanced Khmer preprocessing settings applied
✅ Lower confidence thresholds (0.3) for Khmer
✅ Large-v3 model selection for Khmer
✅ Multi-strategy transcription approach active

## 🎯 Expected Impact

### For the Specific User Issue:
The transcription "So, slide on it. So, slide on it." would now be:
1. **Detected** as a false positive
2. **Rejected** by the enhanced algorithm
3. **Re-processed** with forced Khmer strategies
4. **User notified** about the potential issue with helpful tips

### General Improvements:
- **Higher accuracy** for Khmer speech recognition
- **Reduced false positives** from English mis-detection
- **Better user experience** with informative feedback
- **Robust fallback strategies** for difficult audio

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified:
1. **`voice_config.py`**: Enhanced preprocessing, thresholds, false positive detection
2. **`voice_processor.py`**: Multi-strategy transcription, better audio conversion
3. **`message_handlers.py`**: Improved user feedback and false positive handling

### Dependencies:
- **faster-whisper**: Core transcription engine
- **pydub**: Audio preprocessing
- **Regular expressions**: Pattern matching for false positive detection

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Custom Khmer Model**: Fine-tune Whisper specifically for Khmer
2. **Audio Quality Assessment**: Pre-analyze audio quality before transcription
3. **Context-Aware Detection**: Use conversation history for better language detection
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Learn from user corrections to improve accuracy

### Monitoring:
